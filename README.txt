README file for promo-optimization repo (Case Study for MBC group interview)

To solve the promo optimization problem presented in the case study, I defined the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (with optimization) and wrote an algorithm that uses backtracking to find the most optimal solution.

I defined the hard constraints and the soft constraints (optimizations) given the problem description.


The output of this code gives the best (most optimal) solution that maximizes the total reach of the promo placements on the TV grid.
The output also shows the total reach of the solution (and the total reach for high, medium and low priority promos)

note: some slot segments are empty in the optimal solution

Instructions:
============

1- clone the repo


2- install requirements using the command: 

pip install -r requirements.txt


3- run the program using the command: 

python run_promo_optimizer.py
